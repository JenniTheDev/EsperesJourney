## About The Game: 

* A 300 year war between humans and monsters, called The Cataclysm, drove monsters into slavery or hiding. </br>
* The Hero Esperè was once a legendary warrior among the Monsters.
* During the final battle between both humans and monsters, Esperè came to face the Human King one-on-one. But with his newly gained strength from the Elixir, he had successfully slain the hero and knocked her off the tower. </br>
* The hero descended into the river, being carried into the underground sewers of the Monster's Realm. </br>
* An Elder from the temple of Syleste (the main deity the monsters worship) performed a self-sacrificing ritual. Her act revived Esperè from death, but she remained comatose, until she finally awakens 20 years later. </br>
