## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a> <br>

Espere's Journey is a 2D adventure game where Espere must survive the underground sewers of the Monster's Realm. Development began during the Fall 2020 semester, when JP pitched his idea and we started from nothing. Everything in this game is created original for this project, including all art, sound effects, storyline and game design. Espere's Journey is still under development. 

Espere's Journey uses Unity Version 2019.4.3f1
